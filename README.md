# **Data Analysis with Azure Synapse Analytics**  

## **Project Description**  
In this project, I explored **Azure Synapse Analytics** to process, manage, and analyze large-scale data in a cloud environment. I worked with **Azure Data Lake, SQL pools, and Apache Spark** to gain hands-on experience in cloud-based data management and analytics.  

As part of this process, I **cloned a GitHub repository containing exercises for the Azure Data Engineer (DP-203) certification**, set up the necessary Azure resources, and performed various data processing tasks. Below is a summary of the key steps I completed:  

## **Steps Taken**  

### **1. Environment Setup**  
- **Deployed an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace** to work with cloud-based data solutions.  
- Cloned the **Azure Data Engineer DP-203 repository from GitHub** and used PowerShell commands to initialize the required resources.  
- Explored different components such as **SQL pools, Apache Spark pools, and Data Lake** within the Synapse workspace.  

### **2. Data Ingestion and Preparation**  
- **Ingested data from an HTTP source (CSV file) into Azure Data Lake Storage.**  
- Used **the Copy Data Tool in Azure Synapse Studio** to configure data source, destination, and file format.  

### **3. Data Analysis Using SQL**  
- Analyzed data using **serverless SQL pools.**  
- Executed SQL queries to **filter, aggregate, and group data** by product categories.  
- Performed **JOIN and GROUP BY operations** to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.  

### **4. Big Data Analysis with Apache Spark**  
- Utilized **Apache Spark pools and PySpark** for large-scale data analysis.  
- Applied grouping, filtering, and aggregation techniques on large datasets.  
- **Visualized the results in Synapse Studio** using built-in charting tools.  

### **5. Working with Dedicated SQL Pools**  
- Used **dedicated SQL pools** for a more structured data processing approach.  
- Conducted relational data analysis and **optimized SQL queries for performance.**  
- Aggregated sales data by **month and year** to generate structured reports.  

### **6. Resource Management and Optimization**  
- **Deleted unnecessary resources to prevent extra costs.**  
- Managed cloud resources efficiently by **pausing and cleaning up unused services** in Azure.  

## **Key Learnings & Insights**  
ðŸ”¹ **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Gained hands-on experience with core components and learned how to handle large-scale data processing.  
ðŸ”¹ **Data Pipelines (ETL processes)**: Developed skills in **moving, transforming, and managing data** within Azure Data Lake.  
ðŸ”¹ **SQL & Apache Spark**: Used **SQL for structured data queries** and **PySpark for large-scale data analytics.**  
ðŸ”¹ **Cost Optimization**: Understood the importance of managing cloud resources effectively to **reduce unnecessary expenses.**
